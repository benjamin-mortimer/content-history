## They call it variance

Content history sort of exists on GOV.UK at the moment, but it exists in different ways on different formats.

It's also managed in different ways in the apps.

The big publishing apps are:

+ Mainstream publisher
+ Whitehall publisher
+ Manuals publisher

## Mainstream publisher

Mainstream publisher uses editions.

You create a new edition to make a change to content, no matter how small the change is.

An edition can be in one of the following states:

+ published
+ draft
+ archived

Only published drafts are visible on the web.

'Edition notes' are attached to draft editions and are used internally - they're never published. You make notes for any sort of change, no matter how small. There are some good examples of changes of various sizes and the associated notes on the [Jobseeker's Allowance guide](https://publisher.publishing.service.gov.uk/editions/590302c2e5274a1635ed53b4/history).

## Whitehall publisher

Similar to Mainstream but the world can see the notes.

## Manuals publisher

Manuals publisher distinguishes between 'minor' and 'major' changes.

Minor changes are published silently. Major changes require a change note.

Change notes in Manuals publisher are published in the `/updates` section of the manual you've changed.

For example, if you make a major change to the 'Support for government publishers' manual, the change note will appear at [/contact-the-government-digital-service/updates](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/contact-the-government-digital-service/updates).

Previous versions of manuals are lost - the notes are the only record of changes.
